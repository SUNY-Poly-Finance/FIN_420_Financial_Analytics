\section{Description}
\label{sec:org276cc66}

An overview of analytical methods used in finance, and their applications.  Particular focus will be paid to methods for handling large data sets used in high-frequency trading, and machine learning and artificial intelligence methods applied to banking, investments, and energy markets.
\subsection{Course Learning Outcomes \& Objectives}
\label{sec:org5004388}

\begin{itemize}
\item CLO 1. Technical Competence: Adept in applying analytics technology to solve institutional problems and enable effective financial decision making.
\item CLO 2. Analytical Problem Framing: Demonstrate individual capacity to evaluate and deploy analytical methods selected from a diverse portfolio of tools analyze and manage common financial decisions.
\item CLO 3. Strategic and Integrative Thinking: Understand the baseline resources available for analyzing and managing a firmâ€™s financial performance. Including collecting data, processing information and evaluating and communicating outcomes with partners; differentiate between the accounting function as a preparer of data and information and the finance function as a user of information for decision making and the role of ethics in the process.
\item CLO 4. Leadership and Communication: Be capable of expressing key concepts and terms commonly used in financial analytics; by using effective written, oral and interpersonal communications to contribute to the financial performance of financial firms.
\end{itemize}
\section{Due Dates}
\label{sec:orgacaee6b}

The week 1 Colab notebook is due February 1.  Each Sunday thereafter the next Colab notebook is due.  For example, the week 2 Colab notebook is due February 8th.

It is important that you submit your assignment by the due date, particularly early in the semester.  By doing so we can identify any issues early.  If you submit your notebook after the due date you will receive a 0 on the assignment.
\section{How to Submit Your Colab Notebook}
\label{sec:org9ab71a1}

To submit your notebook simply paste the link to your completed notebook in the D2L/Brightspace dropbox.  There are two additional key points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure your Colab notebook sharing setting is set to 'viewable by anyone on the web'.  I can't grade your notebook if I can't see it.
\item If you open a notebook and modify it, it doesn't automatically create a new URL.  So if you copy the URL and submit it, you are giving me a link to \emph{my own notebook} with none of your changes. So once you modify a notebook that you want to submit, save the Colab notebook to Google Drive to create a unique URL.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Course Outline}

\section{Attendance/Participation}
\label{sec:orga0ddc9c}

Throughout the semester I will take attendance, may give unannounced quizzes, and otherwise evaluate your participation.  Failure to attend class and participate will reduce your participation score.

\subsection{An Important Note on Grading}
\label{sec:orgf00abf6}

\begin{quote}
There is no special consideration if you need a certain grade in this course to graduate.  \textbf{\textbf{If you require a certain grade in this class to graduate it is your responsibility to earn that grade.}} Specifically if you receive a `D` in this course I will not allow you to do extra assignments after the course is complete in exchange for a higher grade. 
\end{quote}
\section{How To Ask Questions}
\label{sec:org3f0bc81}

The more information you provide, the more likely I will be able to answer your question.  If you simply say "I got an error" then you should not expect anyone to be able to help.  At the very least provide the text of the error.

\href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask}{See this post.}  
\section{Email Communication}
\label{sec:orgfc50659}

Questions about course material should be asked in class.  Email should only be used for personal matters.  When sending an email, be sure to put the course in the subject line (FIN 420).
