Throughout the semester I will take attendance, give unanounced quizzes, and otherwise evaluate your participation.  Failure to attend class and participate will reduce your participation score, unless your absence is due to a **verifiable** medical or family emergency.  In such a case you must provide documentation.

** An Important Note on Grading

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is no special consideration if you need a certain grade in this course to graduate.  **If you require a certain grade in this class to graduate it is your responsibility to earn that grade.** Specifically if you receive a `D` in this course I will not allow you to do extra assignments after the course is complete in exchange for a higher grade.

* How To Ask Questions

The more information you provide, the more likely I will be able to answer your question.  If you simply say "I got an error" then you should not expect anyone to be able to help.  At the very least provide the text of the error.
