* Due Dates

#+begin_comment
The week 1 Colab notebook is due January 28.  Each Sunday thereafter the next Colab notebook is due.  For example, the week 2 Colab notebook is due February 5th.

It is important that you submit your assignment by the due date, particularly early in the semester.  By doing so we can identify any issues early.
#+end_comment

Summer courses are accelerated---you complete a full 14 week course in 8 weeks.  Therefore you will average more than 1 week [[https://financial-education.github.io/python_for_finance_outline/][in this outline]] every week of this course.  Assignments (weeks in the outline) 1 through 6 are due June 21.  Assignments 7 through 12 are due July 19.  

* How to Submit Your Colab Notebook

To submit your notebook simply paste the link to your completed notebook in the D2L/Brightspace dropbox.  There are two additional key points:

1.  Make sure your Colab notebook sharing setting is set to 'viewable by anyone on the web'.  I can't grade your notebook if I can't see it.
2.  If you open a notebook and modify it, it doesn't automatically create a new URL.  So if you copy the URL and submit it, you are giving me a link to /my own notebook/ with none of your changes. So once you modify a notebook that you want to submit, save the Colab notebook to Google Drive to create a unique URL.

* Course Outline

[[https://financial-education.github.io/python_for_finance_outline/][See the weekly Colab Notebook links and videos in the course outline.]]

* Exams

There are no exams scheduled, however a final exam may be added at the instructor's discretion. 

* Attendance/Participation

#+begin_comment
You will receive participation points for using the discussion board to ask and answer questions.  Sending me emails asking non-personal course related questions (against the course communication policy) will cause you to lose participation points.
#+end_comment

Throughout the semester I will take attendance, may give unannounced quizzes, and otherwise evaluate your participation.  Failure to attend class and participate will reduce your participation score.

** An Important Note on Grading

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is no special consideration if you need a certain grade in this course to graduate.  **If you require a certain grade in this class to graduate it is your responsibility to earn that grade.** Specifically if you receive a `D` in this course I will not allow you to do extra assignments after the course is complete in exchange for a higher grade.

* How To Ask Questions

The more information you provide, the more likely I will be able to answer your question.  If you simply say "I got an error" then you should not expect anyone to be able to help.  At the very least provide the text of the error.

[[https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask][See this post.]]  

* Email Communication

Questions about course material should be asked in class.  Email should only be used for personal matters.  When sending an email, be sure to put the course in the subject line (FIN 420).
