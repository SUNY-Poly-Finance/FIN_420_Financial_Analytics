* Exams

There will be two brief exams---a midterm and a final.

* Attendance/Participation

Throughout the semester I will take attendance, give unanounced quizzes, and otherwise evaluate your participation.  Failure to attend class and participate will reduce your participation score, unless your absence is due to a **verifiable** medical or family emergency.  In such a case you must provide documentation.
